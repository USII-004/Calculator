# Calculator
A basic functional calculator app. Functionalities have been implemented using javaScript. This project will help me test out my JS skills

basic web design has already been created using HTML and CSS, Funtionalities will be added using javaScript as i begin learning about object oriented programming using JS.

this calculator now works well, but there is still an error noticablel when we repeatedly press the "." (decimal point button) repeatedly, this should not be so. i need to make the calculator so that only one decimal point should be displayed (includes function do not work as this would have made it pretty easy to use an if statement)

# Scientific calculator
All i want to include a toggle that will turn the calculator to a scientific calculator, but  i know this is going to require a more knowledge of OOP.
